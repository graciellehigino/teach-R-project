These materials are part of an R course I co-taught in mid-2017 and are meant to be a primer for absolute beginners.

Lessons 2, 4 and 5 are adapted from Roger Peng's excellent [Exploratory Data Analysis course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis), 
which is part of the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), 
created by Johns Hopkins Professors Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Brian Caffo.
I highly recommend this Specialization!

Please feel free to use the slides as you like, e.g. learning or teaching, but please remember to give credit where it is due. 

I also recommend looking at Roger Peng's [Exploratory Data Analysis Course](https://leanpub.com/exdata/), 
which is available for little or no money (you decide!) on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com).

You can see the original source code for the [course](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/tree/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis) 
and [book](https://github.com/rdpeng/exdata) on [GitHub](https://github.com).

The lessons go in this order: 
1. [Rbasics](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/courses/en/Intro2R/Rbasics.nb.html),
2. [BasePlot](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/courses/en/Intro2R/BasePlot.nb.html),
3. [Theoph](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/courses/en/Intro2R/Theoph.nb.html),
4. [Qplot](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/courses/en/Intro2R/Qplot.nb.html), &
5. [ggPlot](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/courses/en/Intro2R/ggPlot.nb.html)

Preview the html files with the links above or open up the R notebooks (.Rmd files) in RStudio to run the code. 
You can also open the .Rmd files on GitHub.
