## The Funniest R course in the World

Yes, I know: if you got the [reference in the title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienp4J3pW7U), you might be thinking that this should be a Python course... Well, Python is great, but R can be very fun too, and I will show you that (hopefully)! And [look at the bright side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlBiLNN1NhQ): this one will not kill you. ;)

### And now for something completely different!
(I’l try to stop with the [Monty Python references](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGK8IC-bGnU) soon… I mean, probably)

OK, this is actually not a course, sorry. But you could think about this as a collection of small (supposedly) fun examples of R features, and they could work inside your own course. The idea is to surprise the students with things completely different of what they would expect, and, with that, we can manage to **make learning R more fun and interesting for them**.

My experience as a Biostatistics teacher here in Brazil taught me that most of the Biological Sciences undergrad and grad students are completely scared of Statistics. And they are also usually scared of R and its evil looking command line! So having to learn Statistics on R can feel like the most frightening hell for them... But the truth is that they most of those fears are unfounded, and as they put them aside they are able to learn and actually enjoy using R! I built this small collection of unusual tutorials with that scenario in mind: I want to make students curious about R, and hope this could help them feel stimulated for learning it!

### Content:

Most guides here are inspired in some old tutorials I built over the last couple of years in my R related blog, and if you are familiar with Portuguese, you can [check them out here](https://cantinhodor.wordpress.com/arquivo/).

I’ll list every guide here as soon as they are done, so you should consider coming back here from time to time.

There is nothing here right now, but the first guide should be available today and bring some space opera battles inside your R graphics. And you can expect stuff like:
- Pokemon;
- Game of Thrones;
- Heavy metal lyrics!
