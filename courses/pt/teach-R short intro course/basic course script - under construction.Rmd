### Using R for the very first time

Using R for the first time can be a little intimidating, especially if you have never used any kind of command line interface before. I know the feel: you open the program, start looking at the cursor blinking in the first line, and feels as if it is asking you “now, what?”, and you just don’t know what to say… But it is easier than you think, really! R is a language, so you just have to type something that makes sense to it, and it will talk back to you. Since R understand math, you can start off with something simple, so go ahead, type a simple math operation (such as a simple addition) and type enter. You will see something like this:

```{r}
10 + 10
```

That was easy, right?

Go ahead and try a few more operations. You can to use `/` for divisions and `*` for multiplications:

```{r}
5-30

5*5

17/3
```

Oh, you can also use `^`to assign a power operation, just like this:

```{r}
3^2
```
