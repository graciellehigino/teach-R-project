###About this guide

So, you want to teach an R course, uh? Well, that’s awesome, and this project was created to help you! This small course was designed to work both as a very short and friendly introduction to R for Biological Science students and researchers and as simple model for what kind of material a course inside the Open Teach-R Project could (or should) have.

OK, so let’s get things done! If you want to teach this course, you are at right place. Go through this guide as you take a look at the course resources:

- presentation slides;
- course R script (and source code in RMarkdwon);
- data;
- the source code in RMarkdown for this guide.

**The presentation slides**

I built those slides considering that this course might be the first contact that the participants have with R, so I spend some time explaining a little bit of R history, format and purpose. Personally, I find that teaching at least a little bit of history and background behind methods and tools is usually very useful for learning, as the students can understand why things are the way they are.

The slides are mostly self-explanatory, so I’ll just comment a few points here:
